# R-Helpdesk

## What is this repository for?
This repository includes all tutorials and other materials written by me for my current employment as a student assistant at the Communication Science Department 
at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.
As the R Helpdesk, our goal is to support both students and teaching staff with learning and using R in social science research. 
As a faculty that is currently moving towards embracing Open Science principles, it is important to be transparent and genuine about sources. Using an open programming language helps in this endeavor by providing a helpful framework that enables replicability of one's research. 

With time, this repository will be updated with current and past documents (including FAQs, links to other resources, etc.).
All righful owners of the materials will be cited and/or linked to.
